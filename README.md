To separate the "Generative AI with Microsoft CoPilot" section as its own distinctive area within your `README.md`, we can adjust the structure to more prominently feature this segment. This adjustment ensures that users can immediately identify and navigate to the Generative AI projects, highlighting their uniqueness and significance within your portfolio. Here's how you might revise the README to accommodate this:
